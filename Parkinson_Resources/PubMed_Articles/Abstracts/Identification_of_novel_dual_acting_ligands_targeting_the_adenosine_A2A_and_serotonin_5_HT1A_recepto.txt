PMID: 37850444

Abstract:
GPCRs are a family of transmembrane receptors that are profoundly linked to various neurological disorders, among which is Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is the second most ubiquitous neurological disorder after Alzheimer's disease, characterized by the depletion of dopamine in the central nervous system due to the impairment of dopaminergic neurons, leading to involuntary movements or dyskinesia. The current standard of care for PD is Levodopa, a dopamine precursor, yet the chronic use of this agent can exacerbate motor symptoms. Recent studies have investigated the effects of combining A2AR antagonist and 5-HT1A agonist on dyskinesia and motor complications in animal models of PD. It has been proved that the drug combination has significantly improved involuntary movements while maintaining motor activity, highlighting as a result new lines of therapy for PD treatments, through the regulation of both receptors. Using a combination of ligand-based pharmacophore modelling, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics simulation, this study intends on identifying potential dual-target compounds from IBScreen. Results showed that the selected models displayed good enrichment metrics with a near perfect receiver operator characteristic (ROC) and Area under the accumulation curve (AUAC) values, signifying that the models are both specific and sensitive. Molecular docking and ADMET analysis revealed that STOCK2N-00171 could be potentially active against A2AR and 5-HT1A. Post-MD analysis confirmed that the ligand exhibits a stable behavior throughout the simulation while maintaining crucial interactions. These results imply that STOCK2N-00171 can serve as a blueprint for the design of novel and effective dual-acting ligands targeting A2AR and 5-HT1A.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.
