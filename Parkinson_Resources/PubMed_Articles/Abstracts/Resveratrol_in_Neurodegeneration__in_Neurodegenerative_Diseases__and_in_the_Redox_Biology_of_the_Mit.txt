Title: Resveratrol in Neurodegeneration, in Neurodegenerative Diseases, and in the Redox Biology of the Mitochondria.
PMID: 38765928

Abstract:
Neurodegeneration is a process leading to the progressive loss of structure and functions of neurons. Many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease have shown many common points at the subcellular level. Neurons are metabolically active cells and need a high amount of energy. Mitochondria are known as the energy synthesis center for cells, involved in the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate by oxidative phosphorylation. Rather than just being an energy synthesis center, it has critical importance for many cellular functions such as calcium homeostasis, cell proliferation, cell growth, and apoptosis. In the process of mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular functions are disrupted and cells enter the apoptotic or necrotic pathway. Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4-trihydoxystilbene), a plant-derived polyphenol found in the seed of grapes, berries, peanuts, and wine, has many biological effects such as inhibition of lipid peroxidation, scavenging of free radicals, changes in eicosanoid synthesis, inhibition of platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activity, and regulation of lipid metabolism. Through the reviewed literature, the current study investigated the protective role of resveratrol in neurodegenerative diseases. Studies show that resveratrol moderates mitochondrial function, redox status, and cellular dynamics in both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> experimental models of neurodegeneration. Resveratrol suppresses reactive oxygen species production by reducing the activity of complex III due to its competition effect with coenzyme Q. In the present work, we discussed the protective effects of resveratrol on neurodegeneration, neurodegenerative diseases, and the redox biology of the mitochondria.
