Title: The entrancing role of dietary polyphenols against the most frequent aging-associated diseases.
PMID: 37486109

Abstract:
Aging, a fundamental physiological process influenced by innumerable biological and genetic pathways, is an important driving factor for several aging-associated disorders like diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In the modern era, the several mechanisms associated with aging have been deeply studied. Treatment and therapeutics for age-related diseases have also made considerable advances; however, for the effective and long-lasting treatment, nutritional therapy particularly including dietary polyphenols from the natural origin are endorsed. These dietary polyphenols (e.g., apigenin, baicalin, curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, kaempferol, quercetin, resveratrol, and theaflavin), and many other phytochemicals target certain molecular, genetic mechanisms. The most common pathways of age-associated diseases are mitogen-activated protein kinase, reactive oxygen species production, nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells signaling pathways, metal chelation, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and inflammation. Polyphenols slow down the course of aging and help in combatting age-linked disorders. This exemplified in the form of clinical trials on specific dietary polyphenols in various aging-associated diseases. With this context in mind, this review reveals the new insights to slow down the aging process, and consequently reduce some classic diseases associated with age such as aforementioned, and targeting age-associated diseases by the activities of dietary polyphenols of natural origin.
